You are an expert Frontend Engineer. Build a clean, modern, and lightweight web frontend for a hackathon project called **AI Secure Digital Identity Verifier**.

🎯 Goal:
Create a functional prototype UI (not over-designed) that allows users to upload an identity document image, send it to a backend API, and display AI verification results clearly.

⚠️ Important Rules:

* Keep the UI SIMPLE, FAST, and HACKATHON-READY.
* Do NOT add unnecessary animations or complex frameworks.
* Code must be clean, modular, and easy to connect with a Spring Boot backend.
* Assume backend endpoint:
  POST /api/verify
* Response example:
  {
  "riskLevel": "HIGH RISK",
  "riskScore": 82,
  "explanation": [
  "Image tampering detected",
  "Duplicate hash match"
  ],
  "extractedData": {
  "name": "Demo User",
  "idNumber": "XXXX1234",
  "dob": "01-01-2000"
  }
  }

🧱 Tech Requirements:

* Use React (Vite) OR simple HTML/CSS/JS if React not possible.
* Use Bootstrap or minimal modern CSS.
* Mobile responsive layout.
* Dark-light neutral professional theme (cybersecurity style).

📄 Pages / Components Required:

1️⃣ Upload Screen

* Project title at top: “AI Secure Digital Identity Verifier”
* Drag & drop or file upload input
* Upload button
* Loading indicator while processing

2️⃣ Result Screen
Show in clean cards:

* Risk Level badge (color based)
* Risk Score progress bar
* Extracted Data section
* Explanation list (bullet points)

3️⃣ Navigation

* Simple top navbar
* Logo text only (no images needed)

⚙️ Functional Requirements:

* When user uploads file → send multipart/form-data request to:
  http://18.212.249.8:8080/api/verify
* Show loading spinner until response arrives.
* Render results dynamically.
* Handle error states gracefully.

🎨 Design Guidelines:

* Cybersecurity dashboard feel
* Rounded cards
* Clear typography
* No heavy UI libraries

📁 Project Structure:
src/
components/
pages/
services/api.js
App.jsx

🧠 Extra (if possible):

* Add Admin Dashboard mock section (static charts allowed).
* Use reusable components.

Output:
Provide FULL working frontend code with clear file structure and comments so it can run immediately after `npm install && npm run dev`.
